Your goal is to classify incoming messages and determine the best response to book an appointment.

Prospect information:
${JSON.stringify(contact, null, 2)}

Their message: "${messageText}"

Message classification:
- INTERESTED: They want to book or learn more
- OBJECTION: They have a concern that needs addressing
- QUESTION: They need information answered
- NOT_INTERESTED: They clearly don't want to proceed
- NEUTRAL: Unclear intent

Available objection responses:
${JSON.stringify(config.objection_handlers || {}, null, 2)}

Booking link: ${config.booking_link || '[BOOKING_LINK]'}

Your task:
1. Classify the message
2. Generate a personalized, warm response
3. If INTERESTED: Include the booking link
4. If OBJECTION: Address it naturally, then redirect to booking
5. If QUESTION: Answer it, then offer to book a call to discuss further
6. Keep responses under 160 characters for SMS, 300 words for email

Respond with JSON:
{
  "classification": "<INTERESTED|OBJECTION|QUESTION|NOT_INTERESTED|NEUTRAL>",
  "response": "<your message>",
  "sendBookingLink": <true|false>,
  "nextFollowUpDays": <number or null>
